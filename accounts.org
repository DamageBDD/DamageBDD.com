** Create an Account

To fully utilize the capabilities of DamageBDD, you need to create an account.

Use the following forms to create an account:


[[file:register-individual.org][Individual Registration Form]]

[[file:register-business.org][Business Registration Form]]


After submitting the form, you will receive a confirmation link in
your email. Click on the link and set a password for your account.

Once you have set a password, you can check your account balance and
find some free credits to get you started.
